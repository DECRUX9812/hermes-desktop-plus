 * The muted-text ramp — how much of the theme foreground the tertiary and quaternary text

 * `applyTheme` sets them inline, and this table is the one place the numbers live so a contract
 * test can hold every built-in skin to a legibility floor.
 *
 * Light needs more ink than dark for the same perceived weight: a mid-grey on white falls
 * under 4.5:1 long before its dark-mode mirror does, which is why one shared alpha left light
 * skins' meta text (timestamps, paths, hints) faint.
