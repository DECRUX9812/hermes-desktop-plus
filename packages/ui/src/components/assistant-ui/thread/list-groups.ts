// twelve reads is one grey summary line, a thought is one collapsed
// disclosure, a hoisted `todo` is nothing — while a diff, an image card or a
// wall of markdown really does build DOM and is charged for it.
//
// Pricing by payload instead had the budget counting work that never mounts:
// one tool-heavy turn measured 84-281 units of tool JSON that painted as a
// dozen one-line summaries, so a session spent the whole page in two or three
// turns and offered "Show earlier" over a screen and a half of transcript.
//
// "Show earlier" prepends another page; whole turns stay intact so the sticky
// human bubble never loses its turn. This is the long-session perf lever WITHOUT
// a virtualizer — pure rendering, never touches scrollTop, so it can't fight
// use-stick-to-bottom (the single scroll owner).
//
// 600 units ≈ 10-20 agentic turns on measured real sessions (a tool-heavy turn
// prices at 30-90, a plain exchange at 5-10), and a whole session of ordinary
// work now fits one page instead of paging three times to reach its start.
// What the DOM can hold is bounded above by the store window regardless
// (TRANSCRIPT_WINDOW_BUDGET), so this cannot admit more than one window's
// content.

// budget above is sized for ONE full-height pane; a grid split shows several
// panes at once, each a fraction of the screen — yet each was still mounting
// the full budget. Four visible panes meant 4x the mounted message fibers,
// and every streaming flush pays selector re-runs and React commit traversal
// over ALL of them — measured as the 4-zone collapse in the long-session
// matrix (worst-second 8fps while 1-2 zones held 50+). Sharing the budget
// keeps "screens of scrollback" constant instead of "turns per pane": a pane
// gets its proportional share of the page (MIN_VISIBLE_GROUPS still floors the

// changes — the share only caps where NEW backfills stop.
