/**
 * Team-room orchestration: when a group room's local members are exactly one Bot Team's seats
 * (`tools/bot_team.py` org tree), the room listens through the LEAD only — one RPC answers who
 * that is, and every teammate stays asleep until addressed (@mention or the lead's delegation).
 * Unresolved — no covering team, ambiguity between teams, a paused lead, or an older gateway
 * that predates `bots_team.room_lead` — means the room keeps fan-out listening, unchanged.
 * A TRANSIENT failure (the socket reconnecting after a profile switch) is not "no team": it
 * retries, then keeps the lead this member set last resolved to, so a blip never wakes the
 * whole team for one turn.
