/**
 * Room lifecycle: soft-disbanding a group chat — its memberships, room log,
 * stored state and open views — without touching the members' sessions.
 */

/**
 * The group-chat room surface: the merged room view, its settings dialog, the
 * MAIN-window tab it opens into, and the two room-lifecycle mutations that
 * surface drives — disband and rename.
 *
 * Disband and rename live here rather than beside the pane registry because a
 * rename re-opens the room's main tab, and that tab renders this file's
 * workspace: settings dialog → rename → open → main view → workspace is one
 * cycle, so it is one module. The tab registry and the composer drafts they
 * touch stay below, in `group-panes.ts`.
