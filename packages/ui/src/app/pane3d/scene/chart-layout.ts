/**
 * Chart3D geometry and placement (architecture §8.9) — pure and three-free.
 *
 * The chart is a board: a row of bars standing on a plinth with a grid plane
 * behind them. This module owns its world-unit size, the column positions, the
 * pane-side choice for presenting it BESIDE the avatar row, and the two fits
 * that keep the whole panel inside the pane — the vertical fit for a high
 * anchor edge, and the horizontal fit that squeezes the board when the pane is
 * too narrow to hold the full panel (Y-label gutter included) beside the row.
 *
 * A horizontal floor grid would be invisible: the pane's camera looks straight
 * down -z (scene/camera.tsx), so the grid plane is VERTICAL, behind the bars —
 * the same read as a graph backdrop, and the bars' depth shows as the chart
 * oscillates.
