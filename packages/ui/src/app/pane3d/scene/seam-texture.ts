/**
 * The emergence seam's alpha falloff (§8.4).
 *
 * The seam is a thin additive plane whose width blooms from 1.6 units to 0
 * over 450 ms. A flat plane with hard ends reads as a bright rectangular bar,
 * not as light on the window edge. This module generates the alpha profile in
 * code — no image assets, nothing fetched — so the ends fall smoothly to zero
 * and the bar reads as a bloom.
 *
 * The profile is pure data; `createSeamTexture` only paints and samples it.
 * Keeping the shape here lets it be asserted without a WebGL context.

 *
 * The falloff is a FRACTION of the length, not a fixed number of pixels: the
 * seam plane blooms from 1.6 units to 0 and the texture stretches across it, so
 * a fraction-based taper keeps the same soft shape at every width (a fixed
 * ~10 px end on the 73 px strip would harden as the seam narrowed).
 *
 * The thin axis uses a flat-topped ease instead of the same cosine: the strip
 * is only ~3 px tall on screen, so a full-height cosine would be sampled almost
 * entirely in its dark half and dim the seam by ~2×.
