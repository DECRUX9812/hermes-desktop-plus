/**
 * Warms the renderer's program cache before the pane says `ready` (see
 * `scene/prewarm.ts`). Every registered body — plus the seam and contact shadow
 * that are drawn with one — is committed to the scene off-screen, drawn once,
 * and KEPT mounted: the cache is refcounted, so unmounting them would dispose
 * their materials and release the very programs we just linked.
 *
 * The warm-up has to be a real DRAW TO THE CANVAS, neither `gl.compile` nor a
 * render into a target:
 *
 * - three keys a program by the renderer's clipping state, and only `setProgram`
 *   writes that during a draw. Compiling alone linked the avatars' one-plane
 *   programs under a zero-plane key, so the first emergence recompiled anyway.
 * - three also keys it by tone mapping and output color space, and both are read
 *   off the CURRENT render target: into an offscreen target a material compiles
 *   without `TONE_MAPPING`, so the emergence — which draws to the canvas —
 *   compiled a second, tone-mapped program.
 *
 * None of the warm-up is visible: the bodies sit far below the camera frustum
 * with culling off for exactly this one draw, so the rasterizer discards every
 * fragment, and culling is restored the moment the pass is done. The pane's own
 * first frame repaints the canvas right after. Kept bodies never draw again, and
 * nothing in `$avatars` knows they exist, so `frameloop='demand'` still stops
 * when the pane is idle.
 *
 * The pass runs from a passive effect on purpose: three keys a program by the
 * scene's lights and environment, and drei's `<Environment>` writes
 * `scene.environment` from a layout effect. Warming any earlier would link the
 * wrong programs and the stall would come back.
