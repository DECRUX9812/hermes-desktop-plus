/**
 * The composer's session logic (architecture §8.8).
 *
 * `openComposer` is the single entry point for every trigger (click on an
 * avatar, Enter on its handle, the "Ask" chip). It captures the page context
 * FIRST and only then opens the composer: `COMPOSER_OPEN` is what makes the pane
 * focusable, and focusing steals the selection out of the page (§9,
 * VAL-CONTEXT-002).
 *
 * There is exactly ONE composer: a newer `openComposer` request closes whatever
 * other avatar was still listening, and a capture that resolves after a newer
 * request started never opens at all. Otherwise the superseded avatar would stay
 * stuck in `listening` with no composer, leaving the pane focusable forever.
 *
 * The captured context lives in `$composer`; a chip's × records the field in
 * `removed`, so `composerEffectiveContext` is what a task ever receives. The
 * tasks feature installs the submitter through `setTaskSubmitter` at the
 * composition point; without one a submit just closes the composer.
