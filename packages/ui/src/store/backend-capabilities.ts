/**
 * Backend capabilities — what the backend this window is dialed into can do.
 * One resolver owns the verdict; every caller reads the atom.
 *
 * Today's `hermes serve` backends are POOLED (one process per
 * connection+profile): no canonical session authority, no gap-free replay, no
 * shared controls — a server→client request can only be answered from the
 * surface holding the transport. Upstream's one-gateway cutover
 * (NousResearch/hermes-agent#106742) advertises the canonical answers on
 * `gateway.capabilities`; a backend that doesn't answer those keys IS the
 * pooled verdict — the absence is the answer, so a probe failure and a pooled
 * backend resolve identically and there is no hidden-canonical case.
