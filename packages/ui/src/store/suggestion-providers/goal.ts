/**
 * Goal-first plan chips (roadmap #20): the NEW-session draft — the empty box
 * a fresh chat starts as — offers to frame what the user types as an outcome:
 * `/plan` writes a plan to .hermes/plans/ without executing, `/goal` sets a
 * standing goal the session works toward. Two real slash commands, offered
 * as pills so the draft leads with intent instead of a naked question.
 *
 * The provider opts into `includeShortDraft`: its trigger is WHERE the draft
 * sits (the null-session draft bucket), not what it says, so the chips are
 * visible before the first keystroke — the "one box, one outcome" the item
 * borrows from rabbitOS. Invoke only edits the draft (a `/plan ` or `/goal `
 * prefix where slash routing expects it); the pill never sends on the user's
 * behalf, and once the draft leads with a slash the provider stands down.
 *
 * Only the null-session draft qualifies: a session that exists already has
 * its task — chips there would re-frame an in-flight conversation.
