 * The contract is deliberately thin: a nudge only writes draft text for the
 * user to review and send. Nothing auto-acts and nothing calls the model —
 * the trigger is a dot-state transition and the heuristics are regexes over
 * text the app already holds. A nudge withdraws the moment the session starts
