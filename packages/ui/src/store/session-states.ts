/**
 * MULTI-SESSION VIEW STATE — the reactive face of the per-runtime session
 * cache (`sessionStateByRuntimeIdRef` in use-session-state-cache).
 *
 * The cache already ingests EVERY session's gateway events; only the view
 * was single-session ($messages + the active-id gate). This store mirrors
 * the cache per runtime id so any number of surfaces (session tiles, future
 * pane windows) can each subscribe to one session's state without touching
 * the main chat's `$messages` pipeline — same pattern as `useSessionSlice`
 * over `$todosBySession`, applied to whole `ClientSessionState`s.
 *
 * TILES are the first consumer: sessions opened side-by-side with the main
 * thread, each in its own layout-tree pane. `$sessionTiles` holds the
 * stored-session ids (persisted — tiles survive restarts); the wiring layer
 * owns resume/submit (it has the gateway + cache internals) and registers
 * itself here as the delegate so tile UI stays dependency-light.
