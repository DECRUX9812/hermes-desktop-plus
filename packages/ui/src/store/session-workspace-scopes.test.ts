/**
 * `$sessionWorkspaceScopes` — the one map answering "which workspace bucket
 * does this session sit in" for a reader that doesn't know which surface
 * holds the chat.
 *
 * Two producers file the same answer under different keys: a tiled session
 * carries its scope on the tile record (openSessionTile stamps it), a session
 * in MAIN has no tile so its scope is remembered in `$botChatScopes` by
 * setSessionTileWorkspaceScope. The merged atom must cover both, and a tile's
 * own record must win over a stale remembered entry — the surface the
 * session is actually on is the authority.
